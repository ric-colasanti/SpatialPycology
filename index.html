        <h4>Objectives </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>I think in agent based transport models – each agent will have a daily activity plan (start time and
                    end time and location of different activities), and part of it will be the trips (with it’s mode,
                    origin, destination, and route). So I guess that would make them assigned to an agent as we want to
                    model each agent individually and they would decide which activities to conduct and where, and how
                    to get to those places along the network. But this is not necessarily the ‘shortest paths’ – they
                    are more like the ‘chosen paths’</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use geojson derived from OpenStreetMaps to create the "physical" environment</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Written in Python</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Run on multi core (GPUs if possible)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create an Ethology Engine (this is the core of the project)</p>
            </li>
        <li>
            <p>Write a 'Pac man' that runs in a urban environment with Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde capturing the individual Ethology of the 4 Ghosts</p>

            <ol type="A">
                <li>Blinky (also known as the "Red Ghost" or "Shadow"): Blinky is the leader of the ghosts and is
                    programmed to chase Pac-Man directly. He is the most aggressive of the ghosts and will always try to
                    catch Pac-Man.</li>
                <li>Pinky (also known as the "Pink Ghost" or "Speedy"): Pinky is the second ghost in the line and is
                    programmed to try to get in front of Pac-Man and ambush him. She is the fastest of the ghosts, but
                    is not as aggressive as Blinky.</li>
                <li>Inky (also known as the "Blue Ghost" or "Bashful"): Inky is the third ghost in the line and is the
                    most unpredictable of the ghosts. He is programmed to try to ambush Pac-Man, but his behavior is
                    influenced by the positions of both Pac-Man and Blinky.</li>
                <li>Clyde (also known as the "Orange Ghost" or "Pokey"): Clyde is the last ghost in the line and is
                    programmed to chase Pac-Man, but will sometimes stop and return to his home base. He is the slowest
                    of the ghosts and is the least aggressive.</li>

        <h4>The Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)</h4>
        <p>The Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) is a mathematical result that provides a way to determine if two convex polygons are colliding in two-dimensional space.

            The basic idea behind SAT is that if there exists a line (called an axis) that separates the two polygons, then they are not colliding. Conversely, if no such separating axis exists, then the polygons are colliding.
            
            To check for collisions using SAT, we first project each polygon onto a set of axes that are perpendicular to the edges of the polygons. We then check if there exists an axis along which the projections of the two polygons do not overlap. If such an axis exists, then the polygons are not colliding. If no such axis exists, then the polygons are colliding.
            
            In practice, we can optimize the SAT algorithm by only checking axes that are perpendicular to the edges of the polygons. This is because if the polygons are colliding, then there must exist at least one such axis along which the projections overlap. By checking only these axes, we can often quickly determine if the polygons are colliding or not.
            
            SAT is a powerful and efficient algorithm for collision detection between convex polygons, and it is widely used in computer graphics and physics engines.</p>
